        <h1>:active</h1>
        <p>Anchors and buttons are where it is usually used. It applied to things a user can click with a mouse and
            that will change state. It is a short-lived temporary state while the user is holding down the mouse
            button.</p>
        <h1>:focus</h1>
        <p>Form elements and things that are focusable by keyboard or mouse. Think about what happens when adding a
            tabindex to an element. It can now be focused. Focus can last for a while. The element will remain focused
            until the user clicks on or tabs to another element.</p>
